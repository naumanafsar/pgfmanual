# The Tikz and PGF Packages

-------

I am currently reading the "The Tikz and PGF Packages" which is basically the documentation of a LaTeX package called Tikz. The files in the repository that are starting with a number e.g 01.tex are the sections, and the files with the names are little tricks that come along with it (call it subsection or whatever).
